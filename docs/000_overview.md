# NFL
The NFL project brings together 4 different sources to create a single analysis db
- NFLverse: creates a convenient place to get a look at all the important basic stats
- Advanced stats: allows us to look at more advanced stats like yards per route or explosive %
- Player props: allows us to create player rankings based on vegas props
- Gamelines/spreads/totals: gives us a look at the games as whole providing a bit more context
