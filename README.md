# Sports Data
## This repo stores SQL schemas and supporting files for sports-related databases that I am building and maintaining.

## Each sport or data source is modeled independently, with its own schema and documentation.

## The idea is to create standalone dbs/projects within each sport... that may also feed into an analysis db for the respective sport.

## Design notes and reasoning live in the `docs/` directories within each section.
